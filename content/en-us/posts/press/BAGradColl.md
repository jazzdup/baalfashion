Throughout July 2012 until September 2013 the graduation collection “start wearing purple” and the new size system was born. It accompanied Jen’s Bachelor thesis on definitions of femininity, for which he interviewed 25 Transwomen in Berlin on how they defined femininity as a whole, what it feels like and what it means both personally and in the context of their Transidentity and in society.The responses inspired a Fashion collection that would express in textiles what the women had said in words. 
Jen also took the interviewees measurements and merged them with the measurements of the cis-male system to create a whole new size.
