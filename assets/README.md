Baal is a trans-positive Fashion label, that was founded in 2013 in Berlin, by Jen Hartmann.


There are three collections : "Start wearing Purple", "Kiss from a rose" and "Resurrection".                                     

The label is based in London and works towards a fashion reality, in which Transgender women will not have to compromise on fit and style anymore. The garments are created in our very own size system, which uses the measurements of real transfemale bodies. 
Designwise, Baal is all about finding artful solutions to the particular challenges of dressing a female mind in a male body.
